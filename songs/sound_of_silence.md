I've come to talk with you <wrapper><chord>Am</chord></wrapper>again<br>
Because a vision softl<wrapper><chord>F</chord></wrapper>y cree<wrapper><chord>C</chord></wrapper>ping<br>

<br>
<verse number="2:"></verse>In restless dreams I walked alone<br>
Narrow streets of cobblestone<br>
'Neath the halo of a street lamp<br>
I turned my collar to the cold and damp<br>
When my eyes were stabbed by<br>
The flash of a neon light<br>
That split the night<br>
And touched the sound of silence<br>
<br>
<verse number="3:"></verse>And in the naked light I saw<br>
Ten thousand people, maybe more<br>
People talking without speaking<br>
People hearing without listening<br>
People writing songs that voices never share<br>
And no one dared<br>
Disturb the sound of silence<br>
<br>
<verse number="4:"></verse>"Fools," said I, "You do not know<br>
Silence like a cancer grows<br>
Hear my words that I might teach you<br>
Take my arms that I might reach you"<br>
But my words like silent raindrops fell<br>
And echoed in the wells of silence<br>
<br>
<verse number="5:"></verse>And the people bowed and prayed<br>
To the neon god they made<br>
And the sign flashed out its warning<br>
In the words that it was forming<br>
And the sign said: "The words of the prophets<br>
Are written on the subway walls<br>
And tenement halls<br>
And whispered in the sound of silence"
